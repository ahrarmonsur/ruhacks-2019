## Project Jelly: Promoting Conscious Consumerism

The rapid globalization following the industrial revolution created economies of scale benefitting the masses. However, in world driven by profit margins, how our products are sourced and manufactured quickly divulge into a race to the bottom. This contributes to a lack of innovation, class polarization, and violates basic humanrights. In an effort to raise awareness for unethical practices in commercial manufacturing, our Project Jelly creates awareness of unethically sourced products, and sheds a light on locally sourced alternatives. We hope to play a part in protecting basic human rights, while giving local economies an opportunity to grow in a crowded marketplace
